# Sigstore Timestamp Authority

A service for issuing [RFC 3161 timestamps](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161).

Timestamps conform to the [RFC 3628 policy](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3628).

## Local development

To launch the server:
* `docker-compose up`
* `go build ./cmd/timestamp-server && ./timestamp-server serve`

Both of these commands launch a server with an in-memory signing key and certificate chain. **This should not
be used for production.**

To fetch a timestamp:
1. Retrieve the verification chain: `curl localhost:3000/api/v1/timestamp/certchain > ts_chain.pem`
1. Build client: `go build ./cmd/timestamp-cli`
1. Create test blob to sign: `echo "myblob" > myblob`
1. Fetch timestamp: `./timestamp-cli --timestamp_server http://localhost:3000 timestamp --hash sha256 --artifact myblob --out response.tsr`
1. Verify timestamp: `openssl ts -verify -in response.tsr -data "myblob" -CAfile ts_chain.pem`
1. Inspect timestamp: `openssl ts -reply -in response.tsr -text`

## Production deployment

To deploy to production, the timestamp authority currently supports signing with Cloud KMS. You will need to provide
a certificate chain (leaf, any intermediates, and root), where the certificate chain's purpose (extended key usage) is
for timestamping.

Provide the path to the chain with `certificate-chain-path`, and the KMS key with `timestamp-signer`. The key should be prefixed
with either `gcpkms://`, `azurekms://`, `awskms://`, or `hashivault://`.
